# MazeAssignment
NYU - VR Maze assignment
Unity assets used - Low poly dungeons and Material, both of them are present in the asset folder
ProGrid - Using ProGrid all of the paths and props were assigned
XR Plugins - Modification within the editor helped a lot in the development of the maze. Some of the components are XR Layer, Grab Interactables, Ray Interactables, Interactors, Events etc
Code - The only code written by me is on Win State and Door behaviour
